					<strong>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</strong> (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; 17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), shortened as Sheikh Mujib or
					just Mujib, was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is called the <strong>"<u>Father of the Nation</u>"</strong> in Bangladesh. He
					served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17 April 1971 until his
					assassination on 15 August 1975. He is considered to be the driving force behind the independence of
					Bangladesh. <br>
					He is popularly dubbed with the title of "<strong>Bangabandhu</strong>" (Bôngobondhu "Friend of Bengal") by the people of
					Bangladesh. He became a leading figure in and eventually the leader of the Awami League, founded in 1949 as an East
					Pakistan–based political party in Pakistan. Mujib is credited as an important figure in efforts to gain political autonomy for
					East Pakistan and later as the central figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the Bangladesh Liberation
					War in 1971. Thus, he is regarded "Jatir Janak" or "Jatir Pita" (Jatir Jônok or Jatir Pita, both meaning "Father of the
					Nation") of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina is the current leader of the Awami League and also the Prime
					Minister of Bangladesh. <br>
			
					An initial advocate of democracy and socialism, Mujib rose to the ranks of the Awami League and East Pakistani
					politics as a charismatic and forceful orator. He became popular for his opposition to the ethnic and institutional
					discrimination of Bengalis in Pakistan, who comprised the majority of the state's population. At the heightening
					of sectional tensions, he outlined a six-point autonomy plan and was jailed by the regime of Field Marshal Ayub
					Khan for treason. Mujib led the Awami League to win the first democratic election of Pakistan in 1970. Despite gaining a
					majority, the League was not invited by the ruling military junta to form a government. As civil disobedience
					erupted across East Pakistan, Mujib indirectly announced independence of Bangladesh during a landmark speech on 7 March
					1971. On 26 March 1971, the Pakistan Army responded to the mass protests with Operation Searchlight, in which Prime
					Minister–elect Mujib was arrested and flown to solitary confinement in West Pakistan, while Bengali civilians,
					students, intellectuals, politicians and military defectors were murdered as part of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. During
					Mujib's absence, many Bengalis joined the Mukti Bahini and, helped by the Indian Armed Forces, defeated the Pakistan
					Armed Forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War. After Bangladesh's independence, Mujib was released from Pakistani
					custody	due to international pressure and returned to Dhaka in January 1972 after a short visit to Britain and India.
